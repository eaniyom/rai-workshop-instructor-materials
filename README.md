Thank you for volunteering to be an instructor for this workshop. This is the instructor's guide for the Azure Machine Learning's RAI dashboard workshop.  

In this repository, you would find the following information:

- **The workshop website**: [Azure Machine Learning: Responsible AI dashboard workshop](https://ruyakubu.github.io/rai-dashboard-workshop/).   This includes: the workshop objectives, use case definition, setups instructions for azure resources, and the Lab instructions.
- **PowerPoint Presentation deck** with embedded video of presenter.
- **Lab Discussion questions**.  These are discussion questions for the end of each lab.

The overall structure of the workshop is to be engaging and interactive.  To achieve this, the following should be the format:

	1) The instructor will introduce a topic and concepts in a subject area.
	2) There will be a breakout session for workshop. participants to complete each lab of the workshop in teams.
	3) The instructor and the workshop will reconvene for a group discussion with questions pertaining to each subject area and lab.
	4) Then the instructor will proceed to the next concept.


Roles & Responsibility:

- **Instructor**: is the proctor that facilitates the workshop.
- **Presenter**:  The Powerpoint deck with the embedded video of Ruth Yakubu as the presenter should be as the main presentation deck (for compliance).  

**NOTE**:  The slides without the video should be used only as backup by the Instructor if there are network connectivity issues preventing the videos from being played.  It is importance not to make claims that the RAI dashboard will eliminate or solve all Responsible AI issues.
